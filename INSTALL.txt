On most UNIX-like systems, you can install phpmyadmin-cli by running one of the 
following install commands as root or by using sudo.

  git clone git://github.com/fdev/phpmyadmin-cli.git
  cd phpmyadmin-cli
  python setup.py install

or

  pip install git+http://github.com/fdev/phpmyadmin-cli


Important: Because of incorrect file permissions in the prettytable package,
the following error can occur when running phpmyadmin-cli:

  IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '.../prettytable-0.7.2.egg-info/top_level.txt'

Until an updated version is available, the following workaround is provided:

  sudo find /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/prettytable-0.7.2-py2.7.egg/EGG-INFO/ -type f -exec chmod a+r '{}' \;
